                        </a>
                        <p> Students in on-campus housing are not receiving meals that meet their daily dietary
                            restrictions/preferences while in quarantine. The users need a way to communicate their specific dietary
                            needs to the school to allow them to get healthy and appropriate meal options while recovering from
                            COVID-19. Our solution should allow them to customize meals, indicate dietary needs, and choose between
                            meal options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

                            Team Banana came together to put specifics on paper about how to attentively feed students on campus in
