                <h2>Problem Statement: Meals for Students in Quarantine</h2>
            </a>
            <p> Students in on-campus housing are not receiving meals that meet their daily dietary
                restrictions/preferences while in quarantine. The users need a way to communicate their specific dietary
                needs to the school to allow them to get healthy and appropriate meal options while recovering from
                COVID-19. Our solution should allow them to customize meals, indicate dietary needs, and choose between
                meal options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
